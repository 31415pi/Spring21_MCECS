Multiple Choice:
Which is not an Encoding Scheme:
	A. One-Hot encoding
	B. One-Hot-Binary encoding
	C. Gray Code encoding
	D. Johnson Count encoding

What are the four procedural blocks called?
	A. Always_comb, Always, always_ff, always_latch
	B. Always, Always_key, Always_ff, Always_comb
	C. Always_ff, Always_comb, Never, Always_latch
	D. Always_latch, Always, Never_latch, Always_pick

When running vsim or vlog from command line, does order of files matter? Why?
	Yes, because dependencies are not inferred from future files when referenced. They must have already been present in the build environment to be referenced. 

What is one way to prevent accidental latching in a FSM using a case?
	Default: next = Beginning state.

What are:
	System Tasks and Functions: Tasks perform operations with no return value, functions return some value.
	Program Blocks: Provide entry points to Test Bench excecutions. Create container which holds tasks and other functions or class objects. Program Blocks help to avoid race conditions and are excecuted during the reactive region of a sim cycle.
	Modules:
	Parameters:
	
What goes into a portlist?
	Inputs and Outputs for the current module definition.

When instantiating a module with parameters, how do we adjust their values?
	module demomod demomod_instantiated
	#(
		parameter1 = setting,
		parameter2 = resetting,
		parameter3 = set
	)

Define the operations of each component of the Three Process FSM model:
	• A state sequencer — a sequential logic block (flip flops) that transitions from a current state to a next state on a clock edge.
	• A next state decoder — a combinational logic block that decodes various signals to
	determine what the next state of the FSM should be.
	• An output decoder — a combinational logic block that decodes the current state
	(Moore architecture), and possible other signals (Mealy architecture), and sets the
	values of the outputs of the state machine.

What is the primary difference between a Moore and Mealy state machine?
	Moore: depends on current state only.
	Mealy: depends on more than simply the current state.

• A state sequencer — a sequential logic block (flip flops) that transitions from a current state to a next state on a clock edge.
• A next state decoder — a combinational logic block that decodes various signals to
determine what the next state of the FSM should be.
• An output decoder — a combinational logic block that decodes the current state
(Moore architecture), and possible other signals (Mealy architecture), and sets the
values of the outputs of the state machine.

There are four types of always procedures that are used at the RTL level: always, always_comb, always_ff and always_latch. Chapter 6, section 6.1 (page 211) explores the use of always procedural blocks in greater detail.
